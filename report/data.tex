\chapter{The Data}

The data set we will be analysing contains vehicular information about 205 auto mobiles. This features includes dimensions, engine specifications and vehicle characteristics. It also contains an experts assessed risk to the insurer of the vehicle on an integer scale of -2 to 3 with 3 being most risky and -2 being least risky. In addition to the technical information and the experts assessment the data set also contains the normalized loss to the insurer. This ranges from 65 to 256 and is normalized for all vehicles within a particular size classification (two-door small, station wagons, etc) and represents the average loss per car per year \cite{Automobile}.

Initially we will only examine a selection of the vehicular information. Also we will start by aiming to replicate the expert's assessment of risk using our chosen classifier.
